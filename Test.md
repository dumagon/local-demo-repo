# My very amazing markdown document 

So , how do we actually write a .md document?


~~pain features of markdown documents:~~

*let's go Italic parlo? kidding*

**main (*can't get rid of ~~Italian~~ Italic roots*) features of markdown documents:** 

1. It's just like markup language but easier to write
      
       1. and more fun!
2. You can write greatly decorated pages without any high-ticket editors
3. It is easy to convert into a markup language such as *HTML* 

*look , another cool option for lists of items :*

1. You don't have to
1. Mark every item in the list with the correct number 
1. To get the items listed in the right sequence
1. So you can shuffle them without renumbering by hand 


## Also ##

- you can create a messy list (*unorganized*)
- [you can put some code in it](#hmm-not-bad-right-what-about-some-code)

Folks,let's add some ~~strange looking~~ formatted text :   `com.zach.Java_for_Dummies`



## Hmm, not bad right? What about some code? ## 

```java
package com.zach.Java_for_Dummies.examples;

import static java.lang.System.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

class DummyLoop{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner keyboard =new Scanner(System.in);
while(true){
 out.println("Please, type in a number");
 int number=keyboard.nextInt();
 if(number>0 && number<10){continue;
 }
 if(number==0){  break;}
  out.println("entered "+number);


} out.println("done");

}
}
```
